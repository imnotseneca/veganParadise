This is the **first website** I built for my portfolio. Designed a new brand, in this case a Vegan food commerce. Experimented with web design along the code making to finally get this result. All of the content was manually developed with HTML CSS and JS vanilla and was a challenge for myself to prove and implement the knowledge I adquired at that point of my learning process for being a Software Developer. Manually designed and coded, using "Mobile First" ideas to create this responsive Landing Page.
